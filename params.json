{"name":"Cookbook-hs","tagline":"Haskell (and lisp!) is served. ","body":"## Cookbook Library\r\nCookbook is a tiered general-purpose library. It builds upon itself to create an extensive pool of functions to choose from. Cookbook contains functions ranging from highly generic (i.e, ([a] -> a -> [a] and [a] -> [a] -> [a] working on the same function) to very specific, like Quill2, the database language API with type safety.\r\n\r\nSound interesting? Here's some examples.\r\n\r\n`after \"field:item\" ':'` => `\"item\"` \r\n \r\n`after \"field:item\" \"d:\" => `\"item\"` \r\n \r\n`splitOn \"field,field,field\" '.'` => `[\"field\",\"field\",\"field\"]` \r\n\r\n`contains \"field\" 'e'` => `True`  \r\n\r\n`encompassing \"field{field{field{x}}}\" ('{','}')` => `\"field{field{x}}\"`\r\n\r\n`import Cookbook.*.Meta` => Import all modules in that branch\r\n\r\n## Cookbook Map\r\n\r\n* Meta\r\n* Essential\r\n  * Meta\r\n  * Common.hs     (Cm)\r\n  * Continuous.hs (Ct)\r\n  * IO.hs         (Io)\r\n* Ingredients\r\n* Meta\r\n  * Functional\r\n        * Meta\r\n\t* Break.hs (Br)\r\n  * Lists\r\n        * Meta\r\n\t* Access.hs    (Ac)\r\n\t* Encompass.hs (En)\r\n\t* Modify.hs    (Md)\r\n\t* Stats.hs     (St)\r\n  * Tupples\r\n        * Meta\r\n\t* Assemble.hs (As)\r\n\t* Look.hs     (Lk)\r\n* Recipes\r\n  * Meta\r\n  * Algorithm.hs      (Ag)\r\n  * Cline.hs          (Cl)\r\n  * DataStructures.hs (Ds)\r\n  * Math.hs           (Ma)\r\n  * Sanitize.hs       (Sn)\r\n  * WordStats.hs      (Ws)\r\n* Project\r\n  * Configuration\r\n\t* Configuration.hs (Cf)\r\n\t* Configuration.std\r\n  * Preprocess\r\n\t* Preprocess.hs (Pp)\r\n\t* Preprocess.std\r\n  * Quill\r\n\t* Quill.hs (Qu)\r\n\t* Quill2\r\n          * Meta\r\n\t  * Q2Prelude (Q2p)\r\n\t  * Q2Parse   (Q2r)\r\n\t  * Q2Api     (Q2A)\r\n\t  * Q2Io      (Q2Io)\r\n\t  * Q2.std\r\n\t* Quill.std\r\n\r\n## Ports\r\nCookbook has active ports to D and Lisp, which in the next development cycle will be brought to the same level of Cookbook-hs.\r\n\r\nCookbook-lisp: [Github](https://github.com/natepisarski/cookbook-lisp)  \r\nCookbook-D: [Github](https://github.com/natepisarski/cookbook-d) \r\n\r\n## Get Cookbook  \r\n\r\nCookbook can be installed easiest via the **cabal** command-line program. [Hackage page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cookbook)\r\n\r\n`cabal install cookbook`\r\n\r\nIt has a Debian package wrapper in the repository that will call the cabal program for you, for easy installation via gdebi or a similar program. If none of these options work, it can be installed manually by the clone URL.\r\n\r\n### Clone cookbook\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/natepisarski/cookbook-hs` \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
