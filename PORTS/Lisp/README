This is most of the Cookbook library, ported to Common Lisp. The libraries are ready for use as-is. In order to use them, load them into your lisp project with (load). 

Directory layout, as per bpp syntax:

|PORTS
||LISP
||^Common.lisp
|||Ingredients
||||Lists
|||||^Modify
|||||^Access
||||Functional
|||||^Breaks
|||Recipes

There is no included makefile at this time, but all Libraries are tested and work as intended.
