This is an implementation of a functional library in an imperitive language. If you haven't guessed, there is a lot of unsafe stuff going on here. Does it compile? Yeah, with -std=c99, because I'm lazy. But there are no gaurauntees that it will work. It worked on the input that I gave it, but because of the differences between functional and imperitive paradigms it can be hard to actaully get this thing off the ground.

Some functions have been moved, some have been ommitted. Some important list functions are gone because of how C-arrays work. They may be added in the future, but it will take a lot of infrastructure to implement them.

Generics were attemptedly (attemptedly?) added by requiring pointers for everything, so prepare yourself for the stack overflows.
