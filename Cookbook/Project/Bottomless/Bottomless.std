standard{
.: Bottomless is an infinitely recursive database language with list and table literals. It is defined by a list of tables, where a table is a list of key-value pairs. One identifier can be matched with an item, list, or table. Each item in a list can be a table as well. It uses whitespace insignificant parsing, so hardcoding style is up for debate.

table1{
 a: {a: {b : c;};};
