===Standard for Scribe
Scribe (codenamed Scribe2, to set it apart from the ungodly mess that was Scribe1), is an infinitely-recursive symbolic database language. Scribe will eventually replace the .std file syntax, as well as Configuration and Quill.

===Example
table1{
a : {a:b; c:d; d:{a:b;c:d;};}
b ~ table1.a;
}

===Example Usage
No current implementation. Command-line utility is planned for Cookbook-app's HEAD.
